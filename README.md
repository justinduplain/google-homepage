## Pride Points

The challenging part of the Google search page is the footer action. The center element ("Carbon neutral since...") is displayed second on larger screens. Also as the screen size gets smaller, the footer elements start to stack. When stacked that second element is displayed first. 

- I used CSS Flexbox to layout out the page
- Media queries, the "order" CSS property and shorthand Flexbox styles allowed for changing order of footer items based on screen size
- Input type selectors and Pseudo-classes were used to style the search text input and search buttons
- Screen reader only heading and label content is in the page per [18f.gov guidelines](https://accessibility.18f.gov/hidden-content)
